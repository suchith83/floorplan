# Status

One section per work order (`planning/prompts/NN-*.md`). Each session updates its own section at
hand-off: done / not done, real numbers, known bugs, and what the next work order needs to know.

## 00 — Repo setup and port of the prototype: **done**
- Sample data moved out of the repo root into `data/stray/<id>` (captures) and `data/zips/`; both
  ignored. Brief at `docs/brief/applied_ai_brief.md`. `planning/` is gitignored (private notes).
- Ported from branch `beta` in three commits (code only, unchanged except tests):
  `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, `fp/bundle.py`, `fp/geometry/*`, `fp/recon/*`, `fp/ingest/*`
  (including `arkitscenes.py`), `fp/damage/*`, `fp/report/*`, `fp/check.py`, `fp/cli.py`, `tests/`.
- Not ported: `eval/` (ARKitScenes ground-truth evaluation), `results/`, `docs/img/`, beta's
  markdown docs, `scripts/collect_results.sh` (copies ARKitScenes outputs; not useful here).
- Tests: 14 pass (`uv run pytest -q`): 13 ported + 1 new Stray-detection guard. Dropped one:
  `test_eval_compares_only_sides_whose_walls_were_both_seen` (imports `eval/arkit_gt.py`, not ported).
- Verifier (fresh clone): `uv sync` + pytest + `fp --help` pass; largest tracked file is `uv.lock`
  (168 KB); no data in main's history.
- Env: Python 3.12.12 via uv (system Python here is 3.14; uv downloads 3.12 itself). See D2.
- `scripts/fetch_data.sh`: a stub that unpacks `data/zips/*.zip` into `data/stray/<id>`; the
  remote source (HF dataset or release) is decided in 08.

**What 01/02 need to know**
- `fp run` on a Stray folder exits with "reader not implemented": `is_stray()` in
  `fp/ingest/__init__.py` runs before the photo check, because `depth/*.png` used to pass as a photo
  folder and sent 3,430 depth maps to MapAnything on Modal. Replace that `SystemExit` with
  `fp/ingest/stray.py` and keep the detection order (test: `test_a_stray_folder_is_not_mistaken_for_a_photo_folder`).
- `rgb.mp4` is nominally 60 fps but really ~46 fps with gaps: use the odometry timestamps.
- `photos.load` writes its JPEG cache to `out/_cache/` relative to the working directory and ignores
  `--out` (known bug, ignored by git; fix in 05).
- Format facts are in `CLAUDE.md`. `arkitscenes.load` passes `up=(0,1,0)`; Stray is also y-up.
  `camera_matrix.csv` differs from per-frame intrinsics (c7d2: fx 1601.1 vs 1581.2): use per-frame.
- `Frame` has no confidence path, IMU or room label yet (GAMEPLAN §3).
- The current `plan.json` is `fp.plan/0.3`, with a 0–1 `confidence` per wall; 01 replaces it with
  `{value, lo, hi}` intervals and a published schema.
- MapAnything and SAM 3 run only on Modal (`fp/recon/mapanything_modal.py`,
  `fp/damage/detect_modal.py`); `modal` is a hard dependency. The local backend is work order 05.
- `fp/check.py` and the CLI help still talk about ARKitScenes; fine to reshape around Stray.
